          <h3>Digital Marketing Skill</h3>
          <p>During a life project in my degree, I had experiences in making social media plans and doing marketing research for a local supermarket.</p>
          <p>
           I am currently working as a digital marketing executive for a mobile application in Hong Kong, which I oversee all the company’s social media accounts (Facebook & Instagram).
           During my work, I have to produce online content daily including both graphics and captions by utilising Photoshop.

          <h3>Problem Solving Skill</h3>
          <p>I have been studying abroad since I was 16 years old, which strengthens my independence and adaptability in various situations.</p>
          <p>Overcoming obstacles leads me to better weigh up difficulties, analyse issues more carefully and become more decisive.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, I have gained international experience by studying abroad having obtained first-hand knowledge of another country’s culture and protocol.</p>
